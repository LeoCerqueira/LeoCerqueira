### Some of my latest works:


[Espaço Terapêutico Mandala](https://zealous-rosalind-9215e7.netlify.app/)

  It is about a mental health clinic with three main psychologists. The web page tells about the history, how they are and how to reach them, show their social media and also a form that the user can leave a message.

  At this work, I could build a web page from zero, by the time I did it I want to use only HTML and CSS and try to find all the solutions by using only these two languages, so I would push my limits on their possibilities.

[Happy](https://github.com/LeoCerqueira/Happy-App)

  This a web page that you can see the location and the information of orphanages nearby, the user can also add more orphanages and interact with them by message.

  I could learn a lot from this project taught by professor Maik Brito, from Rocket seat, which was a very intense and productive week.

[André's portfolio](https://app.netlify.com/sites/zealous-rosalind-9215e7/overview) Unfinished

  This is the project of my brother's portfolio, we were talking about having a portfolio online and decided to start building it, is unfinished. As soon as we have all the photos and texts that we want I will back to it, but it is going well so far, the result is very satisfying.
