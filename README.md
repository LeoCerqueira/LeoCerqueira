### Who I am:

Passionate about technology, I have been studying more and more about the Front-end development areas, developing personal projects, and programming skills. Currently, I develop applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and I continue studying hard to learn more about this fascinating area.

### Some of my latest works:


[Espaço Terapêutico Mandala](https://espacomandala.netlify.app)

  It is about a mental health clinic with five main psychologists. The web page tells about the history, how they are, and how to reach them, shows their social media, and also a form where the user can leave a message.

  At this work, I could build a web page from zero, by the time I did it I wanted to use only HTML and CSS and try to find all the solutions by using only these two languages so that I would push my limits on their possibilities.

[Happy](https://github.com/LeoCerqueira/Happy-App)

  This is a web page where you can see the location and the information of orphanages nearby, the user can also add more orphanages and interact with them by message.

  I learned a lot from this project taught by Professor Maik Brito, from Rocket Seat, which was a very intense and productive week.

[André's portfolio](https://uxandre.netlify.app) Unfinished

  This is the project of my brother's portfolio, we were talking about having a portfolio online and decided to start building it, is unfinished. As soon as we have all the photos and texts that we want I will get back to it, but it is going well so far, and the result is very satisfying. 
  
 [mLabs](https://quizzical-lewin-b8016a.netlify.app/)
 
  Interfaces that allow the user to schedule a publication on a preferred social media, allowing him to view a list of schedules by publication status.
